#  üöÄSIGFormer: Spatial-Temporal Inductive Graph Transformer

`SIGFormer` is a deep learning model for spatio-temporal forecasting and imputation in transportation networks. By leveraging sparse sensor data‚Äîsuch as that collected from fixed sensors, drones, and mobile vehicles‚Äî`SIGFormer`reconstructs missing traffic information with high accuracy. 

This repository implements `SIGFormer` as described in the paper:

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/framework_architecture.png" alt="Framework workflow and model architecture." width="600"/>
</p>


`SIGFormer` is a transformer-based model for reconstructing missing traffic data using spatial-temporal graphs. The framework builds a **masked spatial-temporal graph**, applies **subgraph sampling** for training, and uses **SIGFormer encoder-decoder blocks** to infer missing values. The model captures dynamic traffic patterns and ensures robust data imputation.  

### üìå Key Features  
- Graph-based representation of sparse sensor data  
- Inductive learning for unseen nodes and time steps 
- Transformer-based encoder-decoder for data completion  
- Adaptive node and adjacency representations  
- Scalable subgraph sampling for efficient training

## Model Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/block_architecture.png" alt="SIGFormer framework architecture." width="600"/>
</p>

**SIGFormer** is composed of several key components:
- **Diffusion Graph Convolution (D_GCN):** Implements a diffusion process using Chebyshev recurrence to capture spatial dependencies.
- **Multi-Head DGCN:** Aggregates outputs from multiple D_GCN layers to capture diverse spatial relationships.
- **Edge-Aware Spatial Attention:** Enhances node features by incorporating learned edge information.
- **Temporal Transformer:** Utilizes multi-head temporal attention and a feed-forward network to capture temporal dependencies.
- **SIGFormerBlock:** Integrates all the above components with residual connections and normalization.

## Configuration

All configurable parameters are stored in `config.yaml`. 

---


## Data Preprocessing üõ†Ô∏è

Raw data from PeMS should be downloaded and placed under `data/raw_data/pems_download`. The preprocessing script **data_preprocessing.py** performs the following steps:
- **Daily File Processing:**  
  Reads daily CSV files to compute a matrix of average flow per lane.  
- **Time Alignment:**  
  Pivots the data into a consistent time-series format with 288 five-minute intervals per day.  
- **Smoothing:**  
  Applies a moving average filter with outlier correction to smooth sensor readings.  
- **Concatenation & Finalization:**  
  Concatenates daily matrices along the time axis and saves the processed matrices as NumPy files (e.g., `data/pems_flow/node_values.npy` and `data/pems_flow/adj_mat.npy`).

## Training

The training pipeline in `train.py`:
- Loads the dataset and splits it into training, validation, and test sets.
- Dynamically selects unknown sensor sets based on a specified ratio (`R_MI`).
- Iterates over the missing patterns defined in the configuration.
- Trains the SIGFormer model for a fixed number of epochs.
- Evaluates performance on the validation set and saves the best model checkpoint per missing pattern.
- Logs training results (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) to a CSV file.

### Running Training

Run training via the unified main entry point:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml --dataset pems_flow --missing_patterns cs s t b r --r_m 0.25 --r_mi 0.25 --output_csv results.csv
```
Or simply:
```bash
python main.py 
```

---

## Evaluation
The evaluation routines in `evaluate.py`:

- Process the test set using non-overlapping windows.
- Impute missing values using a generated missing mask.
- Compute error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) to assess model performance.


### Running Evaluation
- Evaluate a trained model by running:
```bash
python main.py --test --dataset pems_flow --unknown_ratio 0.25 --output_dir evaluation_results --checkpoint <path_to_checkpoint>
```
Or simply:
```bash
python main.py --test 
```

---

## Experiments

_Note: Evaluation results can vary due to the random selection of subgraphs and random seed settings._

### Experiment: Missing Pattern Comparison

The `experiment_pattern.ipynb` notebook (and its script version) compares reconstruction performance under different missing patterns (e.g., cs, s, t, b, r) on a selected subset of sensors.

### Experiment: Sensitivity Analysis
The `sensitivity_analysis.ipynb` notebook is provided for interactive sensitivity analysis of training and inference missing ratio.
